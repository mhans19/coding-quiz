# Purpose<br>
The purpose of this challenge was to create a timed quiz game, where users are penalized if they answer incorrectly. Upon completing the quiz, the top five highest scores are stored in the local storage where they are pulled down as users navigate to view the high scores.<br>
<br>
# User Story<br>
AS A coding boot camp student<br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores<br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers<br>
<br>
# Acceptance Criteria<br>
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz<br>
